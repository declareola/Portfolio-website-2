# Portfolio Enhancement Plan: Roadmap to a World-Class Experience

This document outlines major improvements to transform the OLAK Interactive Portfolio into a truly unique and memorable experience.

## Tier 1: High-Impact AI Integration (Gemini API)

- [x] **Implement an AI Chatbot Assistant:**
    - [x] Create a chat interface component.
    - [x] Integrate the Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash` model).
    - [x] Develop a system instruction to "train" the AI on Olabode's and Aisha's resume, skills, and project data.
    - [ ] The chatbot should be able to answer questions like:
        - "What are Aisha's core strengths in UI design?"
        - "Tell me about Olabode's experience with data analytics."
        - "Summarize the 'DPR Compliance Platform' project."
    - [ ] Add a feature for the chatbot to help schedule a meeting or provide contact info.

- [ ] **Personalized "Why Hire Me?" Generator:**
    - [ ] Add an input field for a user to paste a job description or company name.
    - [ ] Use the Gemini API to analyze the input and generate a tailored paragraph explaining why the selected person is a great fit.

## Tier 2: Enhanced Interactivity & Immersion

- [ ] **Dynamic Cursor Effects:**
    - [ ] Design and implement a custom cursor that leaves a subtle particle trail.
    - [ ] Make the cursor interact with elements on hover (e.g., creating a spotlight or a magnetic pull effect).

- [ ] **UI Sound Design:**
    - [ ] Source or create subtle, futuristic sound effects for UI interactions (clicks, hovers, page transitions).
    - [ ] Add an option for the user to mute all sounds.

- [ ] **Interactive Project Showcase:**
    - [ ] Instead of static text, create an interactive timeline for projects.
    - [ ] Animate project cards as the user scrolls.
    - [ ] Embed live demos or video walkthroughs for key projects where possible.

## Tier 3: Content & Narrative Depth

- [x] **"Behind the Skills" Feature:**
    - [x] Make each skill in the "Expertise" section clickable.
    - [x] On click, open a modal or expand a section with a brief story or a specific example of that skill in action.

- [ ] **Animated Storytelling:**
    - [ ] Use Framer Motion's `useScroll` and `useTransform` hooks to create scroll-based animations that tell a narrative.
    - [ ] For example, animate the "About" text to reveal sentence by sentence as the user scrolls into view.

## Tier 4: Polish & Accessibility

- [ ] **Accessibility Overhaul (A11y):**
    - [ ] Implement a "reduce motion" toggle that disables or simplifies animations.
    - [ ] Ensure perfect keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.
    - [ ] Review all components for proper ARIA roles and attributes.
    - [ ] Test thoroughly with screen readers.

- [x] **Performance Optimization:**
    - [x] Reverted lazy-loading for `PortfolioDetail` to fix a critical module resolution error and ensure application stability.
    - [ ] Optimize all images for the web to improve load times.
    - [ ] Analyze the animation performance and ensure a smooth 60fps experience.
